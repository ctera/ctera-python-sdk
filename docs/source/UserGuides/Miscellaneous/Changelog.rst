   try:
       ...
   except cterasdk.exceptions.io.OutOfQuota as e:
       print('Failure due to quota violation.')

   """Catching expired sessions"""
   try:
       ...

* Introduced support for resolving conflicts during copy and move operations

.. code:: python

   """Override destination on conflict"""
   resolver = core_types.ConflictResolver.override()
   user.files.copy(('My Files/Gelato.pptx', 'My Files/Slides/Gelato.pptx'), resolver=resolver)

   """Resume job from cursor"""
   objects = (
       'My Files/Gelato.pptx', 'My Files/Slides/Gelato.pptx',
       'Spreadsheets/Q1Summary.xlsx', 'Sheets/Q1Summary.pptx'
   )
   try:
       user.files.copy(objects)
   except cterasdk.exceptions.io.FileConflict as e:
       resolver = core_types.ConflictResolver.override()  # override destination
       user.files.copy(objects, resolver=resolver, cursor=e.cursor)  # resume copy from cursor

^^^^^^^^^^

* This version introduces a new ``AsyncEdge`` object for asynchronous access to the CTERA Edge Filer.
* Supported file browser operations include:
  ``listdir``, ``handle``, ``handle_many``, ``download``, ``download_many``,
  ``upload``, ``upload_file``, ``mkdir``, ``makedirs``, ``copy``, ``move``, and ``delete``.
